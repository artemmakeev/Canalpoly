# Canalpoly
Board game


This is a board game inspired by board game made by someone in Russian Radio University from Ryazan in 1970s or early 80s.

It is somewhat similar to monopoly, except there's much more board positions, and 2 shortcuts on the board and these shortcuts 
could be restricted by whoever owns canals. Here's name - Canalpoly.

My goal is to make this available to anyone and allowing basically any modification within current layout. What I mean by layout
is number and position of firms, chances and other game blocks. But chances, firm names and properties 
can be modified without limit. (not implemented yet)

I project it will be ready to play as an alpha version by 06/01/2017
